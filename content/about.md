With over 20 years of real-world <a class="text-red" href="/experience/" >experience</a> designing and developing business software, I have the <a class="text-red" href="/skills/" >skills</a> and expertise to meet the needs of your project.

When I'm not busy freeing fellow humans from their manual, repetitive, and error-prone workflows, you can find me hiking in the <a class="text-red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Mountains">Green Mountains</a>, enjoying international travel, running long distances with my wife Chelsea, and playing the ancient strategy game of <a class="text-red" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a>.
